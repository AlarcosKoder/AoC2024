# 🎭 AlarcosKoder AoC - Advent of Code 2024 🎶

Welcome to **AlarcosKoder AoC**, where code meets mystery, and **everything is concealed**! Inspired by the legendary Hungarian TV show *Álarcos Énekes* (aka *The Singer in Mask*), this repository is my hidden performance. The code is *masked*, and I might not even reveal what’s behind it. Who am I? Well, that's part of the fun.

## What’s This?

I participated in **Advent of Code** two years ago, and now I'm back for another round! But just like before, I’m keeping my identity and my solutions hidden. Will you uncover the logic behind my code? Who knows! It’s all part of the game.

### 🎤 Features (aka What’s Behind the Mask?)
- **Masked code** – The algorithms are like performers in disguise. They may sing, they may dance, but they sure won’t show their true face.
- **Mystery solutions** – Will you be able to decode the puzzles? Can you figure out what’s really going on behind the mask? That’s the challenge!
- **Daily performances** – One new masked solution every day. Will it be a hit or a miss? Come find out!

## 🚨 Warning: Use at Your Own Risk 🚨

Just like the mystery singers, you can never be sure what’s coming next. The code might work… or it might leave you puzzled. No guarantees. No refunds. Proceed at your own risk.

- 🕵️‍♂️ **No warranty** – If things go sideways, remember: I’m under no obligation to explain myself. 
- ⚠️ **Use at your own risk** – If you find yourself addicted to unmasking code, that’s your problem. No refunds for your time.

## 🤡 Masked Solutions
Every solution to the Advent of Code puzzles is wrapped in layers of mystery. The code is hidden, like a performer in disguise, and only you can figure out what it does. Will you crack the code? Will you solve the puzzle? 

## 📅 How to Join the Fun?
Follow along, enjoy the masked performances, and try to solve the puzzles. But remember: who I am and what the code does remains a mystery. Perhaps that’s the greatest puzzle of all.

Good luck, and remember: if it works, it’s magic. If it doesn’t, blame it on the mask.

🎭 Code on, masked coder! 🎤
